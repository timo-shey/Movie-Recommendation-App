# Movie-Recommendation-App

The movie search application is a web application that allows users to search for movies, rate them, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences.

Users can rate movies on a scale of 1-5, and the current average rating of each movie is displayed on the interface. The recommendation feature is based on previous ratings, genres, and directors and provides users with personalized movie suggestions that match their interests.
